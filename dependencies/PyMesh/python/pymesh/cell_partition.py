        mesh (:class:`Mesh`): The input mesh.

    Returns: The output mesh with all intersections resolved and a list of
    meshes representing individual cells.

    The following attributes are defined in the output mesh:

        * ``source_face``: the original face index.
        * ``patches``: the scalar field marking manifold patches (A set of
          connected faces connected by manifold edges).
        * ``cells``: a per-face scalar field indicating the cell id on the
          positive side of each face.
        * ``winding_number``: the scalar field indicating the piece-wise
          constant winding number of the cell on the positive side of each face.
