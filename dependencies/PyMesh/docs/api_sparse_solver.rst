Sparse Linear System Solver
===========================

Solving a sparse linear system is a common operation in geometry processing.  In
addition to the `solvers provided by scipy
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html#solving-linear-problems>`_,
PyMesh brings the power of a number of state-of-the-art sparse solvers into
python.
